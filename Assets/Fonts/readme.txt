This font "Little Conquest" is created by Jack Oatley.

This font is inspired by the type in Sid Meier's Colonization from 1994. Some characters are the same but most are redesigned for a better fit.

It is 100% free to use, though credit is appreciated and it'd be cool to know where you used it. You must not claim it as your own.
